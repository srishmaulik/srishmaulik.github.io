        <h2>Sidequest</h2>
        <p class="project-description"> 
          Sidequest is a social media web application that I made to help people find new places to
          visit in their city. It allows the user to search for the different places in the town based on the location type, 
          like beaches, trails, restaurants, etc, and find the place's name, location, description and pictures and reviews of the place 
          taken by other users. The user can also add their own reviews and pictures of the place. <a href="https://green-river-03ad9281e.4.azurestaticapps.net/">Check it out here!</a>

        </div>
        <p class="project-description"> I used AWS S3 to store the images of the places and tracked the pictures using
          MongoDB. This way I could map each user to their picture and have it displayed for user friendly browsing.

          I also assigned Aura Points based on the number of pictures the user uploaded. This way the user could get a sense of accomplishment.

        <h2>3 dimensional Protein Structure Prediction</h2>
        <p class="project-description"> 
          I made a web app that shows the predicted three dimesnaional structure of a protein in a interactive 3D view
          using the protein's accession id in the Alphafold database. It was intended to make learning about proteins
          and macromolecules fun.

        <p class="project-description"> I used react three fiber to make the 3D view of the protein and used FastAPI to get the protein's structure from the Alphafold database.
          I used spatial geometry features to correctly trace the vector coordinates of each atom in the 3 dimensional
          polypeptide structure.

        <h2>Deployment And Performance Testing</h2>
        <p class="project-description"> 
          I worked on a research project where I deployed microservices on AWS EC2 instances and tested the performance of the services.
          I experimented using kubernetes, docker containers, and split instances to see how the services would perform under different conditions.
